### 16. Technical Writing and Case Study

* **16.1 Technical Writing (1 question Carrying 10 marks):**
  * This section may ask the examinee to write a technical proposal on a given specification, essay, views/critics, etc. The topic must be related to computer technology or related matters, and the examinee should be encouraged to put their own views and reasoning rather than facts/information.
* **16.2 Case Study (1 question Carrying 20 marks):**
  * This section is dedicated to the analysis and design of a software system. The examinee should be given a scenario of an existing system and asked to analyze and design it following one particular paradigm. This section should include various domains of knowledge in one platform (e.g., a case study may incorporate questions from Software Engineering, Database Management, and Operating System domains).
